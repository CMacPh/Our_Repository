Our_Country_Meeting.1.d:0 "It was late in the night when the most peculiar of guests decided it was time for a midnight snack in my office.\n\n'Double Diamond, old friend!' Adrian Hoss allows himself in, smiling widely, black coat fluttering energetically behind him. 'It's been a while since we got to have a private chat, hm? A tete-a-tete, as some might say. Please, may I come in? There's something quite important I'd like to talk about-- oh, and I brought tea, too. Warm tea, I'm sure you'll enjoy it."

When the major conversation topics dry up, he decides to make his move.\n\n'Well, Double Diamond, I did promise I had something important to talk about, didn't I? I presume it's about time I got to the point,' he clears his throat. 'I've served Our Town dutifully as economic advisor ever since Starlight left us. It was my policies that keep our economy afloat to this day.'\n\nCan't argue with that. 'It feels greedy of me to ask, but.. Could you not agree that, perhaps, my calling is for something greater than a mere economic advisor? A man... sitting, idly at a desk, watching over paperwork and approving trade tariffs? I feel like there is so much more potential here, but I cannot tap into it from my current position. I know you, however, are a strong leader. The people wouldn't question you if you perhaps... promoted me? Please, allow me to be your political advisor, Double Diamond. Have I ever disappointed you, in the past?"
Our_Country_Meeting.2.a:0 "You speak the truth, as always, get ready you're going to a higher office as of tomorrow."

I told you last time there was no need to knock my friend, come on in' I called out as I reached for my coffee.\n\n'I do apologise Double Diamond, I did not want to walk in on anything private' he excused himself, hanging his coat by the door and trotting in, carrying a rather impressive sized stack of paper.\n\nI eye the stack with equal parts confusion, intrigue and that special type of dread that looming piles of paper can inflict on even the strongest of leaders. 'Important business tonight?' I raise an eyebrow as the paper is dropped onto my desk with an unceremonious thud.\n\n'Ah-' Adrian takes a second to neaten himself up 'quite, however I can always bring this back later if you are not feeling up to it'."
Our_Country_Meeting.5.a:0 "'If it is important then we should deal with it now'"
Our_Country_Meeting.5.b:0 "'Well it is rather late, come back some other time.'"
Our_Country_Meeting.6.t:0 "A Change In Staff"
Our_Country_Meeting.6.d:0 "'Thank you, well to shorten the matter at hand, I have performed a review of our heads of department and have come to a surprising conclusion. It seems like Bob Jones, our current Head of Research, has been cutting the amount of budget being sent to our labs, and has instead been spending it… less academically. That being said I do believe I have a solution' Adrian explains, taking a file from the top of the stack.\n\n'Go on?' I prompt as he slides the file across the desk to me, a faint smile on his lips.\n\n“I happen to know a fine stallion, an old acquaintance of mine, who worked at a well known equestrian university for a decade or so as a researcher. He’s quite well known in his field, and has expressed his interest to me of taking up a higher station. With your word it will be quite simple to fire Bob Jones and replace him with Bob Brown.”\n\n' I already have all the legal paperwork sorted and filed,' he pats the large stack of paper 'so all I need is your word and the rest will be done without any effort of your own'."
Our_Country_Meeting.6.a:0 "'You never fail to impress, do what you must.'"
Our_Country_Meeting.6.b:0 "'I appreciate the effort but i must check this myself.'"
Our_Country_Meeting.7.t:0 "Political Problems"
Our_Country_Meeting.7.d:0 "I slowly and tiredly lean forwards in my office chair, eyeing up the latest set of legislation changes Adrian had brought to my attention, the stallion himself sitting just across the table awaiting my reactions.\n\n'So… I didn’t quite catch that the last time, run it by me again quickly' I ask, taking a gulp of my coffee, a rare zebrican blend, the only thing that was keeping me going these days.\n\n'Well, as you’re well aware, we seem to be running into some minor… speed bumps with how our plans for improving Our Town are going with the general population' I nodded slowly, motioning for him to continue.\n\n'It seems obvious at this point that most of these issues lie on our lack of proper public relations. That being said, I have an easy fix that should give you some more time to rest, overworked as you currently are,' he rests a hoof on the table, looking at me intently 'so, what do you say?'."
Our_Country_Meeting.7.a:0 "'You’re right, Let’s hear your plan'"
Our_Country_Meeting.7.b:0 "'Thank you for your advice, but I shall handle it on my own time'"
Our_Country_Meeting.8.t:0 "A New Position"
Our_Country_Meeting.8.d:0 "'It’s quite simple really' Adrian grins at me 'I suggest we open a new spot on advisory staff. A speaker for you, and the rest of the department heads. They can attend news conferences and speak to the populace, help get rid of any misinformation about what our plans for the future are, and rally supporters for our cause. I-'\n\n'And you already have someone in mind, with all the legal documents filled and filed?' I raise an eyebrow at his precious legal papers.\n\nHe chuckles softly for a second 'Am I really becoming that predictable? Well of course, I wouldn’t be the head of management if I hadn’t already planned for the future would I. He’s an acquaintance of mine, very well versed in public speaking, politics and diplomacy, even managed to talk down a band of griffon bandits last I heard'. He smirked as the information settled in 'and better yet, he’s fully onboard with our policies, so he says he’ll be more than happy to help'."
Our_Country_Meeting.8.a:0 "'Perfect, which one of these documents do I sign then?'"
Our_Country_Meeting.8.b:0 "'An interesting prospect, but I feel that we try some interviews first'"
Our_Country_Meeting.9.t:0 "The Situation Worsens"
Our_Country_Meeting.9.d:0 "The sun was starting to set on the horizon, its red rays spearing over the rooftops of Our Town. Outside, the FreeCorps and the army patrolled the streets dutifully, with flashlights and batons, to break up any would-be protests. I sure hope Adrian knows what he’s doing here, because Our Town has been nothing but a raging dumpster fire the past few days, his measures and ideas only throwing more gasoline in the inferno.\n\nI can only trust him as my friend. Though, as time passes and the ponies jeer and protest right outside my office, I find my trust wearing away."
Our_Country_Meeting.9.a:0 "'I can only trust him'"
Our_Country_Meeting.9.b:0 "I must speak with Adrian about this. It’s getting out of hand.’The"
Our_Country_Meeting.10.t:0 "Rude Awakening"
Our_Country_Meeting.10.d:0 "As I get up from my desk, preparing to leave, I’m quickly forced to duck by the sound of something smashing the window to my office into a dozen shiny pieces. Hiding under my desk, I avoid the shower of broken glass, but I cannot avoid taking a glance of the street right outside the building.\n\n‘We are more than bodies!’ the multicoloured crowd shouts outside in unison. Some hold up boards and banners, and some brandish weaponry. ‘We are ponies! We are citizens of Our Town! Our Town belongs to Our people!’\n\nThe shouting continues outside as two FreeCorps soldiers burst inside my office, uniforms tight over their bodies. ‘Down with Double Diamond! Down with Double Diamond!’\n\nAs the two ponies grab me and begin to escort me to safety, I can only remember the same event happening long, long ago. Except, last time I was merely a bystander, and the crowd was calling for someone else’s demise... ‘Down with Starlight Glimmer! Down with Starlight Glimmer!’"
Our_Country_Meeting.10.a:0 "'We’ll get you to safety, sir. Just stand behind us.’"

Our_Country_Meeting.11.t:0 "Sanitary Cordon"
Our_Country_Meeting.11.d:0 "The lights overhead flicker on and off, until finally dimming and shutting off for good. Another FreeCorps soldier runs down the hallway, barking orders at everyone to evacuate as fast as possible.\n\n‘The main entrance is blocked. We’ll take the side entrance, sir,’ one of the escorting soldiers tells me as we pass through the entrance hall. The wooden front doors bend and buckle, smashed by the hooves of so many disgruntled ponies, who do not know that waiting for them was an unyielding line of grey army uniforms, rifles, grenades and overturned furniture. \n\n‘Break! Break, break!’ a soldier at the cordon shouts as my two escorts tug me through a side passage. Behind me, the sounds of wood splintering echo, followed by the deafening rings of rifles discharging, and of ponies screaming."
Our_Country_Meeting.11.a:0 "’This is madness!’"
Our_Country_Meeting.11.b:0 "’I’ll remember to thank Adrian for suggesting that new security chief.’"
Our_Country_Meeting.12.t:0 "Getaway"
Our_Country_Meeting.12.d:0 "The air outside is cold, and the alley next to the building is damp and musty. Flies buzz around the corpse of a protester, speckled with drops of blood, two bullet holes in his chest.\n\n‘Such is the fate of those who tempt the Leader’s life,’ the FreeCorps soldier tucks his pistol back into its holster, before turning to me. ‘Did the shots damage your ears, sir?’\n\n‘No, no, I’m fine,' I shake my head. Its my first time hearing bullets go off though, its unsettling. ‘Where are we going now?’\n\n‘Out of here,’ he nods. ‘Follow us.’\n\nMy other escort throws a heavy brown cloak over me. It reeks of mildew, as if it’s never been washed, but I suppose that just makes me harder to notice in the dirty, dingy crowd."
Our_Country_Meeting.12.a:0 "In the chaos and fire, we escape unseen."

Our_Country_Meeting.13.t:0 "Aftermath"
Our_Country_Meeting.13.d:0 "Far in the distance, there’s shouting and screaming over the sound of crackling flame. The firefighters are rushing to put out another fire. Since the riot, crime took a sharp increase arson, murder, rape, looting, all increased tenfold, and neither the police, the army, nor the FreeCorps can hold back the people.\n\nThe government building appears to have taken the worst brunt, though. The medics couldn’t have taken away all the bodies in time, so I must step cautiously over the corpse-laden, blood-soaked carpet. The air is heavy with the stench of death.\n\n‘Double Diamond? Double Diamond, there you are,’ I see Adrian push his way through the crowd of his black-dressed men. ‘I didn’t think you’d come.’"
Our_Country_Meeting.13.a:0 "'You called me here, so I came.’"

Our_Country_Meeting.14.t:0 "Emergency"
Our_Country_Meeting.14.d:0 "‘Indeed I have, yes, and with good reason. We…’ he pauses, as if trying to pick out the most proper thing to say. ‘We need to talk, Double Diamond. Follow me.’\n\nMy office is under repairs, blue-clad workmen walking in and out carrying new glass panes for my shattered window, so Adrian takes us to the next best place - the spherical central foyer. His FreeCorps watch over us as we speak, except this time, their aura is not one of protection, but something else. Something apprehensive, which I am less than appreciative of. I realize that, amongst those soldiers, there are plenty of other ponies other state secretaries and ministers, probably also called here by Adrian’s orders.\n\n‘We have to talk about your… recent policies, Double Diamond.’ Adrian tells me."
Our_Country_Meeting.14.a:0 "'Excuse me, MY policies?’"

Our_Country_Meeting.15.t:0 "Lie"
Our_Country_Meeting.15.d:0 "Confused at Adrian’s choice of words, I begin to see what game he’s playing here.\n\n‘My policies?’ I snap. ‘How dare you, Adrian?! This, all of this, all of this is your fault! Everything that has happened, everything that has been ordered for the past… however long you’ve been head of Resource Management… everything that I said came from your mouth!’\n\nHe’s stoic and silent, listening to me with a face showing little in the way of emotion.\n\n‘I trusted you! At every obstacle, at every decision, I listened to you, I did as you had to say, Adrian! And look where that lead us! This entire charade, everything I chose to trust you with, it’s all crumbling now, and it’s all gonna collapse over me, not you!!’"

Our_Country_Meeting.16.t:0 "Perspective"
Our_Country_Meeting.16.d:0 "It hurts, to see him raving like this. To see Double Diamond shout at the top of his lungs at me. It also hurts to know that he’s right - that he is innocent in all of this, that everything which has happened is my fault.\n\nBut, such is fate. Double Diamond was never suited to be a leader. Double Diamond follows orders - it’s why he was Starlight Glimmer’s second-in-command, and why he was so trusting of me. As much as it hurts to admit, Double Diamond was just a pawn, a piece in this game, on this journey to greatness for our people.\n\n‘To think I ever trusted you, I ever promoted you… You’re who you are now because of me, and this is how you repay me? Well? You’re being silent, you traitor… why? Why are you silent?’ He asks me, exasperated, eyes wide, pupils pulsing with rage.\n\n‘I’m sorry, old friend, I must do what has to be done.’ I shake my head to him.\n\n‘What is that supposed to mean!?’ Double Diamond snaps."

Our_Country_Meeting.17.d:0 "My former boss watches in silent shock when he sees what I pull from my coat’s pocket, then gasps when I stab the dagger straight into his neck. Before he can force out any choking, the rest of the ministers rush towards him with their own daggers, leaving behind their marks on his body.\n\nDouble Diamond falls to the ground, body riddled with bleeding, gushing stab wounds. To make sure the deed is one, I then signal one of my men to step forward. He does so, unholsters his pistol, and promptly puts a bullet in his head.\n\nI notice a few of the ministers’ knives to still be shiny and clean, and not tainted with blood. I will have Jim Williams organise a mob to deal with these traitors but now, now is not the time for such actions, now is the time for some speeches."
